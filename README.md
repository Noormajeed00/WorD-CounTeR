# WorD-CounTeR
A word counter is a tool that helps you count the number of words in a given text or document. It's useful for writers, students, and anyone who wants to keep track of their word count for essays, articles, or other written content. With a word counter, you simply input your text, and it will quickly calculate the total number of words for you.
